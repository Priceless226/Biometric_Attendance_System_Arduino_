# Biometric_Attendance_System_Arduino_

ðŸš€ Excited to share my recent project!
This is a Biometric Attendance System (Prototype) using fingerprint authentication with Arduino modules.

It  uses Arduino Uno, RTC module, LCD screen and fingerprint sensor.

This system is designed to make attendance tracking faster, more secure, and efficient, eliminating manual errors while providing real-time verification.

A great hands-on experience combining hardware, programming, and problem-solving â€“ and a step closer to smarter automation solutions.
